Calendar tooltips

The purpose of this little module is simplifying the process of
displaying a tooltip/popup when you hover over a day on a calendar block.
The tooltip would contain a list of events occurring
on that day. Normally you would need to override theme functions
and write code to accomplish this task. I have written some
documentation on my site: http://linuxpc.info/node/83 .
You can post any questions or comments there, too.

This module requires the Calendar, Date, CCK, and Views modules.
It also depends on the Beautytips module you can find on
   http://drupal.org/project/beautytips

I hope this module is useful for you.

Update note for version 6.x-1.3:

The event data shown in the tooltip can now be specified in
the display settings of your calendar view: choose the "Block view"
display, and change the "Fields" section.
